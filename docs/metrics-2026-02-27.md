# Metrics Report — 2026-02-27 (OFA)

## Build / Test Health
- Smoke suite: ✅ PASS (`npm run smoke`)
- Lint: ⚠️ existing `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors in repo (pre-existing; not fully addressed)
- Deploy: via Vercel auto-deploy on `main` merge

## Reliability Learnings
- Firestore `onSnapshot` + optimistic local state can cause UI duplicates; prefer snapshot as source of truth.
- Puppeteer tests should target stable selectors and avoid matching transient toast text.

## Operational KPIs (proxy)
- Regression risk: LOW after smoke stabilization
- Manual test time: ~2 minutes post-deploy checklist

## Suggested next KPIs to track
- Upload success rate (per photo)
- Median upload time (per photo)
- Clock-in/out latency (time to UI state settle)
- Notes completeness rate (jobs with notes/site fields populated)

# Closeout — 2026-02-27 (OFA)

## Summary
Shipped a stability + workflow upgrade bundle to **Omnitrix Field App (OFA)**.

Highlights:
- Fixed Job Logs photo upload UI duplication.
- Stabilized Puppeteer smoke suite + added convenient npm scripts.
- Added Job Logs **Site Info & Notes** with persistence.
- Fixed carry-over bug where new jobs inherited old details.
- Added **auto-save** (debounced) for job details + status indicator.
- Admin Dashboard upgrades: global search + sort + site/notes display + normalized photo handling.

## PRs
- **#1**: `fix/stability-notes-admin` → merged to `main`
  - Smoke suite stabilized
  - Site info/notes (manual save)
  - Admin search/sort + normalized photos
  - Added npm scripts (`smoke`, `smoke:*`, `check`)

- **#2**: `fix/clear-job-details-on-new-job` → merged to `main`
  - Clear job detail fields when no active job to prevent carry-over

- **#3**: `feat/autosave-job-details` → merged to `main` (squash)
  - Auto-save job details (debounced) + save status UI

## Validation
- `npm run smoke` ✅ passing at time of merge
- Manual verification recommended post-deploy:
  - Clock in → details blank; edit details → auto-save / saved status
  - Refresh → details persist
  - Upload 1 photo → no duplicates
  - Admin `/admin` → search & sort work; thumbnails link to images

## Known follow-ups
- ESLint: repo has existing `no-explicit-any` violations in other files; `npm run check` includes lint.
- Consider storing `userName/userEmail` directly on job docs at clock-in, or implement users join in Admin.
- Add image compression before upload (speed + storage).
